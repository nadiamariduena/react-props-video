## A series of recapitulative REACT projects

## The projects like this one, will be accompanied by a video explanation related to the topic.

<p> “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
